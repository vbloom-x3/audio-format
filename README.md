# 🎵 BLOS Audio Codec

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/vbloom-x3/audio-format)  ![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)  ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-linux%20%7C%20unix-blue)!  [Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C-lightgrey)

**BLOS** is a minimal, experimental, **single-file audio format and codec written in C**.
It achieves compression ratios of **5–6%** on 16-bit WAV files, while staying simple and hackable.

## ❓ Why BLOS?

Most modern audio codecs are **big, complex, and dependency-heavy**. BLOS takes the opposite route:

* A **single C file** you can read in one sitting.
* A format that’s **easy to inspect, tinker with, and extend**.
* Compression that’s not the tightest on Earth, but **transparent and surprisingly efficient** for its size.

It’s designed as a playground for learning about **LPC, residual coding, and audio compression basics**, while still being usable for actual audio storage.

## ✨ Features

* 📦 **Single C file** – no external dependencies beyond `libsndfile` and `math`.
* 🎚️ **LPC compression** with Levinson-Durbin algorithm.
* 🚀 **Rice coding** for residuals.
* 🎵 **Mid/Side stereo coding** for efficient stereo compression.
* ⚡ **Transient bypass** for large residuals (stores raw samples when necessary).
* 🧩 **Frame-based, bit-packed, aligned** stream format.
* 💾 Compression ratios around **5–6%** on typical audio material.

## 🔧 Building

Make sure you have **libsndfile** installed.

On Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install libsndfile1-dev   # Debian/Ubuntu
# or
sudo pacman -S libsndfile          # Arch
```

Then clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbloom-x3/audio-format
cd audio-format
make
```

This will produce the executable:

```
./codec
```

## ▶️ Usage

### Encode a WAV file

To compress a raw WAV file into `.blos` format:

```bash
./codec input.wav output.blos
```

**Example:**

Original waveform (`input.wav`):

---

### Decode a BLOS file

To decompress a `.blos` file back into a playable WAV:

```bash
./codec -d input.blos output.wav
```

**Example:**

Decoded waveform (`output.wav`):

![Decoded WAV](assets/decode.png)

## 📂 File Format Overview

* **Magic**: `"BLOS"`
* **Header**: sample rate, frame count, channel count, frame size.
* **Frames**:

  * Seeds (initial samples for prediction).
  * Float64 LPC coefficients.
  * Residuals encoded with **Rice coding**.
  * Escapes for transient bypass.

## 📊 Example Output

During encoding you’ll see progress and per-frame stats:

```
[Encode] frames=1234 frame_size=512
Frame 1/1234: order=12 kA=4 kB=5 meanA=8.2 meanB=7.5 escA=0 escB=2
Encoded frame 1/1234
...
[Encode] done: output.blos
```
